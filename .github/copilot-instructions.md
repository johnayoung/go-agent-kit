# GitHub Copilot Instructions for go-agent-kit

This project uses go-agent-kit for structured AI agent workflows. Use the following commands for systematic development:

## Available Commands

### /feat - Feature Implementation Workflow
Use this command to implement new features with a structured approach.

**Usage:**
```
/feat [description of the feature to implement]
```

**Examples:**
- /feat add user authentication system
- /feat implement REST API with JWT tokens
- /feat add file upload functionality
- /feat create admin dashboard

**What it does:**
Generates a comprehensive 5-stage workflow:
1. **CODEBASE ANALYSIS** - Detect language, examine patterns, find integration points
2. **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN** - Plan files, dependencies, and implementation order
3. **IMPLEMENTATION** - Step-by-step coding with language-specific best practices
4. **TESTING** - Unit tests, integration tests, and edge cases
5. **DOCUMENTATION** - Code comments, README updates, and API docs

### /fix - Bug Fix Workflow
Use this command to systematically diagnose and fix bugs.

**Usage:**
```
/fix [description of the bug or issue]
```

**Examples:**
- /fix null pointer exception in user service
- /fix memory leak in background worker
- /fix authentication not working on mobile
- /fix database connection timeout errors

**What it does:**
Generates a systematic 5-stage debugging workflow:
1. **DIAGNOSIS** - Understand, locate, reproduce, and analyze the issue
2. **FIX STRATEGY** - Plan the fix approach and assess impact
3. **IMPLEMENTATION** - Apply minimal fix with safety checks
4. **TESTING** - Verify fix and run regression tests
5. **DOCUMENTATION** - Document the fix and add preventive measures

## Language-Agnostic Design

These workflows are designed to work with ANY programming language:
- **Go** - Follows Go conventions, error patterns, and testing practices
- **Python** - Uses PEP 8, type hints, and Python idioms
- **TypeScript/JavaScript** - Proper types, async/await, modern patterns
- **Java** - Java conventions, exception handling, design patterns
- **C#** - .NET patterns, LINQ, async/await
- **Ruby** - Ruby style guide, Rails conventions where applicable
- **And many more...**

## How It Works

1. **Language Detection**: Workflows automatically detect your project's language by examining files like go.mod, package.json, requirements.txt, etc.

2. **Pattern Analysis**: The AI analyzes your existing codebase to understand your specific patterns, architecture, and conventions.

3. **Guided Implementation**: Each stage provides specific guidance while respecting your project's established patterns.

4. **Best Practices**: Language-specific guidelines ensure code follows community standards and best practices.

## Integration with GitHub Copilot

When you use these commands in GitHub Copilot Chat:

1. **Copy the generated workflow** from the command output
2. **Follow each stage systematically** - don't skip ahead
3. **Let Copilot examine your codebase** when prompted with @workspace
4. **Implement step by step** as guided by the workflow

## Benefits

- ✅ **Consistent Quality**: Every feature and fix follows the same systematic approach
- ✅ **Language Agnostic**: Works across all programming languages and frameworks  
- ✅ **Best Practices**: Incorporates language-specific conventions and patterns
- ✅ **Comprehensive**: Covers analysis, implementation, testing, and documentation
- ✅ **AI-Optimized**: Designed specifically for AI agents like GitHub Copilot

## Getting Started

1. Run `go-agent-kit install` in your project (already done!)
2. Open GitHub Copilot Chat
3. Try: `/feat add a simple hello world endpoint`
4. Follow the generated workflow step by step
